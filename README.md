- 👋 Hi, I’m @Praetir
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything electrical engineering, however I am mostly interested in the development of ICs and lower level hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming for python. My current interest in python is to create a digital inventory system for my electrical components.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything programming and circuit design, but I have limited ability with programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: no way yet, but soon.
